### Project structure and Usage:

#### Code:  
Scripts, their descriptions, and how to run them in a terminal.

- **GIS_1.R**: Processes vector and raster data: defines, manipulates, and reprojects data; analyzes spatial attributes; and plots maps.

- **GIS_2.R**: Prepares species distribution modeling (SDM) for the mountain tapir by processing species range and occurrence data, integrating bioclimatic variables, and visualizing distributions on geographic maps to analyze current and future habitat suitability.

#### Data
Contains all of the data files used across all of the practicals defined in this repository.

#### Results
To store files outputted from the code directory.
