### Project structure and Usage:

#### Code:  
Scripts, their descriptions, and how to run them in a terminal.

- **BinomialBinaryGLMs.R**:  Runs binomial and quasi-binomial GLMs.
  `source("BinomialBinaryGLMs.R")`

- **ChoosingCovariates.R**: Demonstrates classic model selection using the *a priori* approach.
  `source("ChoosingCovariates.R")`

- **PoissonGLM.R**: Runs and interprets Poisson GLMs.
  `source("PoissonGLM.R")`

- **VariableModelSelection.R**: Demonstrates model selection using the *a priori*, hypothesis testing, and information criteria approaches.
  `source("VariableModelSelection.R")`

#### Data
Input files for various scripts within the code directory.

- **bee_mites.csv**: Death count of mites in response to acaricide.

- **chytrid.csv**: Chytrid infection status (expressed binomially) and climate information, collected 2003-2018.

- **chytrid_binomial.csv**: Chytrid infection status (expressed as a count) and climate information, collected 2003-2018.

- **fisheries.csv**: Ecological survey data collected from several fishery sites from 1977-2002.

- **RUnicorns.txt**: Ecological information on some unicorns.
