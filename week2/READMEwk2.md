- **cfexercises2.py**: Functions that print "hello" based on various conditions and loops.
- **CompileLaTeX.sh**: Compiles LaTeX files, generates PDFs, and opens the PDF viewer.
- **control_flow.py**: Contains functions for determining even/odd numbers, largest divisors, and prime checking.
- **debugme.py**: Demonstrates error handling with try/except blocks.
- **dictionary.py**: Creates a dictionary mapping taxonomic orders to species.
- **lc1.py**: Uses list comprehensions and for loops to extract data from a tuple of bird species.
- **lc2.py**: Uses list comprehensions and for loops to extract data from a tuple containing rainfall data.
- **MyExampleScript.py**: Simple function that squares a number and prints it.
- **oaks.py**: Contains functions to identify oak species and demonstrates set creation using both for loops and list comprehensions.
- **oaks_debugme.py**: Reads from a CSV file, filters oak species, and writes to a new CSV, with debugging support.
- **scope.py**: Explores variable scope, demonstrating local vs. global variable behavior and function variable visibility.
- **sysargv.py**: Demonstrates sys module by printing script name and command-line arguments.
- **test_control_flow.py**: Contains functions for checking even or odd numbers, includes embedded doctests for testing.
- **tuple.py**: Iterates through a tuple of bird species and prints their details.
- **UnixPrac1.txt**: UNIX command-line tools for counting lines, sequence lengths, nucleotide occurrences, and A/T to G/C ratio in FASTA files.
- **using_name.py**: Demonstrates the use of the `__name__` variable to differentiate between script execution and import.
