    Project structure and Usage: 
        Code
            align_seqs.py: Aligns two DNA sequences and computes the best alignment score.
            basic_csv.py: Reads a CSV file and extracts species names and body mass.
            Boilerplate.py: Template for Python applications.
            cfexercises1.py: Includes functions for mathematical operations (square roots, maximum, sorting, and factorials).
            cfexercises2.py: Functions that print "hello" based on various conditions and loops.
            CompileLaTeX.sh: Compiles LaTeX files, generates PDFs, and opens the PDF viewer.
            control_flow.py: Contains functions for determining even/odd numbers, largest divisors, and prime checking.
            debugme.py: Demonstrates error handling with try/except blocks.
            dictionary.py: Creates a dictionary mapping taxonomic orders to species.
            birds: Contains tuples of bird species, including their names and body masses.
            lc1.py: Contains bird species data for processing.
            lc2.py: Analyzes average UK rainfall data by month.
            MyExampleScript.py: Simple function that squares a number and prints it.
            oaks.py: Contains functions to identify oak species and demonstrates set creation using both loops and list comprehensions.
            oaks_debugme.py: Reads from a CSV file, filters oak species, and writes to a new CSV, with debugging support.
            scope.py: Explores variable scope, demonstrating local vs. global variable behavior and function variable visibility.
            sysargv.py: Prints script name and command-line arguments.
            test_control_flow.py: Contains functions for checking even or odd numbers, includes embedded doctests for testing.
            tuple.py: Iterates through a tuple of bird species and prints their details.
            using_name.py: Demonstrates the use of the __name__ variable to differentiate between script execution and import.
        Data
            Files which are used as input for various scripts within the code directory.
        Results
            Files which are outputted from files within the code directory.
