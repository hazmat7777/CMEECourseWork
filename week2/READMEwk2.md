# My CMEE Coursework Repository

### Brief Description
Python scripts introducing key functionalities.

### Languages
- Shell script
- Python

### Dependencies
- **ipdb** (Python)

### Installation
#### Python
- `pip install ipdb`

### Project Structure and Usage
#### Code
- **align_seqs.py**: Aligns two DNA sequences and computes the best alignment score.
- **basic_csv.py**: Reads a CSV file and extracts species names and body mass.
- **basic_io1.py**: Demonstrates file input.
- **basic_io2.py**: Demonstrates file output.
- **basic_io3.py**: Demonstrates saving imported files.
- **boilerplate.py**: Template for Python applications.
- **cfexercises1.py**: Functions for mathematical operations (square roots, maximum, sorting, and factorials).
- **cfexercises2.py**: Functions that print "hello" based on various conditions and loops.
- **control_flow.py**: Contains functions for determining even/odd numbers, largest divisors, and prime checking.
- **debugme.py**: Demonstrates error handling with try/except blocks.
- **dictionary.py**: Creates a dictionary mapping taxonomic orders to species.
- **loops.py**: Introductory examples of for and while loops.
- **lc1.py**: Uses list comprehensions and for loops to extract data from a tuple of bird species.
- **lc2.py**: Uses list comprehensions and for loops to extract data from a tuple containing rainfall data.
- **MyExampleScript.py**: Simple function that squares a number and prints it.
- **oaks.py**: Contains functions to identify oak species and demonstrates set creation using both for loops and list comprehensions.
- **oaks_debugme.py**: Reads from a CSV file, filters oak species, and writes to a new CSV, with debugging support.
- **scope.py**: Explores variable scope, demonstrating local vs. global variable behavior and function variable visibility.
- **sysargv.py**: Demonstrates sys module by printing script name and command-line arguments.
- **test_control_flow.py**: Contains functions for checking even or odd numbers, including embedded doctests for testing.
- **tuple.py**: Iterates through a tuple of bird species and prints their details.
- **using_name.py**: Demonstrates the use of the `__name__` variable to differentiate between script execution and import.

#### Data
- **fasta/**: DNA sequence data in fasta format.
- **bodymass.csv**: Primate body mass data.
- **JustOaksData**: Subset of TestOaksData.csv which are oaks.
- **testcsv.csv**: Classification, distribution and body mass of primates.
- **TestOaksData.csv**: A table containing binomial names of trees.

#### Results
To store files outputted from the code directory.
