Marks for text quality :  6 /8
Comments...
In question 1 very good, well written and shows deep understanding but perhaps a little more long-winded than it needs to be.
In question 2 excellent
In question 5 excellent
In question 6 excellent
In question 14 very good but would have been nice if it had explained a little more about the stochastic loss
In question 18 excellent, would have been nice to mention dynamic equilibrium explicitly
In question 22 very good but could have gone deeper into the 'why' part
 
Marks for graphics quality :  9 /10
Comments...
In question 1 excellent, but if I'm being picky I'd say the box around the legend doesn't look nice.
In question 2 nearly perfect but y axis cuts off a little at the top
In question 5 exemplary
In question 6 exemplary
In question 14 would be nice if the png output had higher resolution
In question 18 exemplary though a higher resolution would have been nice
In question 22 very good but to be perfect I'd expect labelling of the octaves more fully e.g. 1, 2-3, 4-7 and so on, not just 1,2,3,..
In question 26 ideally would have full labels for abundance instead of just octave numbers
 
Marks for code quality :  7 /8
Comments...
very good but not perfect, e.g. it's a mistake not to specify filename extensions on outputted PNG files
 
Marks for challenge questions :  9.5 /14
Comments...
challenge question A, does what was asked but the graph would have been nicer without the grey background and the code needed a bit of coaxing to work beacuse of the multi-threading - a clever thing to do but did make the code less portable
challenge question B, very good but needed fiddling around to work - also could have gone a bit further with the question, no clear error bars on the graph and no attempt to detect and mark the equilibrium
challenge question C, excellent
challenge question D, excellent, though the legend placement obscures the data
challenge question E, a start but incomplete - the graph does not match that from the (correct) cluster simulations and there is not actually a function for challenge_E defined, just a helper function so perhaps this one is unfinished.
